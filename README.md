# Using LLMs for the Extraction and Normalization of Product Attribute Values
This repository contains code and data for experiments on attribute value extraction and normalization using large language models.

## Requirements

We evaluate hosted LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
Therefore, an OpenAI access tokens needs to be placed in a `.env` file at the root of the repository.
To obtain this OpenAI access token, users must [sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup) for an OpenAI account.

## Installation
The codebase requires python 3.9 To install dependencies we suggest to use a conda virtual environment:

```
conda create -n wdc-pave python=3.9
conda activate wdc-pave
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pieutils/
```
