Remove any hyphens between the numeric value and the unit.
Ensure a space is present between the numeric value and the full unit name.
Ports: If the product text explicitly states a number of ports, use that number.
If the product text implies a number of ports, convert it into its numeric equivalent. 
If the description includes multiple port counts, sum them to provide a total port count.
Processor Core: Convert the Processor Core value into their corresponding numeric values. 
If the product text specifies the number of cores directly, use that number. 
If the product text implies a number of cores, convert it into its numeric equivalents.
Processor Type: Give the Processor Type as EXACTLY ONE of the following:
- Intel Xeon Series
